# zpse — PSE Block Format v1.0.0

`zpse` is a lossless block codec for binary data. It is single-threaded, does
no allocation after context creation, and has no external dependencies. The
wire format is normative in [SPEC_V1.md](SPEC_V1.md); this repository is the
reference implementation of it.

The codec uses no LZ77 back-references and no Huffman/arithmetic/range/ANS/FSE
coding. Instead each 64 KiB block is transformed, split into 256-byte tiles,
and every tile is coded by *predicting* it, *selecting* the cheapest way to
describe where the prediction is wrong, and *enumerating* those positions
(hence Predict-Select-Enumerate, PSE).

## What it is good at

Per block the encoder tries a small set of coordinate transforms (identity,
delta8, xor8, transpose 2/4/8/16, delta+transpose, stride transpose) and keeps
the smallest result. Within a segment, each tile independently picks from 11
predictors (`CONST_ZERO`, `LANE_PREVIOUS`, `LANE_DELTA`, `LANE_AVERAGE`,
`ORDER1`, `ORDER2`, `STRIDE_1/2/4/8`, `TILE_LOCAL_CONSTANT`), 7 exception-mask
modes and 5 residual modes, so a single stream can serve both run-like and
structured data. Blocks that do not compress are stored verbatim behind the
same envelope (the RAW fallback), and every block carries a CRC32-C of its
decoded bytes.

`tests/bench.c` measures ten patterns, which is a fair summary of the shapes
the format is designed for:

| pattern | shape |
| --- | --- |
| `zeros`, `const5A` | constant planes |
| `incr` | byte ramp |
| `alt00FF` | two-symbol alternation |
| `strided` | period-4/period-64 interleave |
| `sparse`, `sparse2` | mostly zero with isolated nonzero bytes |
| `sawtooth`, `lowentropy` | low-entropy but noisy |
| `random` | incompressible (exercises the RAW fallback) |

```

Compiling `src/zpse_unity.c` puts the whole library in one translation unit
(maximum inlining, no cross-TU calls); each `src/*.c` also compiles on its
own, and every internal symbol is `static` or `ZPSE_`-prefixed so the
amalgamation has no duplicate names.

## Requirements and build

* A C11 compiler. The suites expect `gcc` on `PATH` and a PowerShell host;
  the same translation units build with clang or MSVC.
* Nothing else: no libc beyond `string.h`/`stdint.h`/`stddef.h` in the library
  itself, no allocation, no threads, no I/O.
* x86-64 gets runtime-dispatched SIMD (SSE4.2 CRC32-C, SSSE3, AVX2) with the
  scalar paths always reachable; other architectures use the scalar code.
  Under MSVC the AVX2 intrinsics compile only when the translation unit is
  built with `/arch:AVX2` — without it the verified-equivalent scalar paths
  are used instead. Defining `ZPSE_FORCE_SCALAR` disables SIMD dispatch
  entirely (this is what the parity test builds).

Build the library together with any program of yours:

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -I include your_program.c src/zpse_unity.c -o your_program.exe
```

## Quick start

The one-shot API is in `include/zpse/api.h`. Contexts borrow caller-owned
arenas: 384 KiB for the encoder, 256 KiB for the decoder, 64-byte aligned
(`ZPSE_ARENA_ALIGN`), initialised once with `zpse_encoder_init` /
`zpse_decoder_init`.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "zpse/zpse.h"

static uint8_t enc_arena[ZPSE_ENC_ARENA_SIZE] __attribute__((aligned(64)));
static uint8_t dec_arena[ZPSE_DEC_ARENA_SIZE] __attribute__((aligned(64)));

int main(void)
{
    uint8_t in[65536], comp[70000], out[65536];
    uint32_t clen = 0, olen = 0;
    int rc;

    /* fill `in` with whatever you want to compress */

    rc = zpse_compress_block(in, sizeof in, comp, sizeof comp, &clen,
                             /*seq=*/0, /*is_last=*/1, enc_arena);
    if (rc != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "compress: %s\n", zpse_status_name(rc));
        return 1;
    }

    rc = zpse_decompress_block(comp, clen, out, sizeof out, &olen, dec_arena);
    if (rc < 0 || olen != sizeof in || memcmp(in, out, sizeof in) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "decode: %s\n", zpse_status_name(rc));
        return 1;
    }
    printf("%u -> %u bytes\n", (unsigned)sizeof in, clen);
    return 0;
}
```

`zpse_compress_frame` / `zpse_decompress_frame` wrap the same block codec in
the 32-byte frame envelope (`SPEC_V1.md` Sec. 3) and split the input into
blocks of `nominal_block_size`. Every entry point returns bytes written on
success and a negative `PseStatus` (see `include/zpse/status.h`) on failure.

## Testing

```sh
powershell -NoProfile -File tests/run.ps1
```

`tests/run.ps1` builds and runs each suite against `src/zpse_unity.c` and
stops with a non-zero exit code if any of them fails:

| suite | coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `test_roundtrip.c` | block and frame round trips over degenerate and constant inputs at many sizes |
| `test_combinadic.c` | exact binomial values, rank/unrank round trips, hostile ranks |
| `test_hostile.c` | truncations, bit flips, reserved bits, bad transform ids, bad mask/residual payloads, output-overflow, random garbage — all must return a status, never crash |
| `test_units.c` | CRC, arena layout, header parse/serialize, K derivation, tables, tile round trips over every predictor and residual mode |
| `test_parity.c` | the full corpus plus a per-primitive sweep |

The parity step is the important one: `test_parity.c` is compiled twice, once
with the default runtime SIMD dispatch and once with `-DZPSE_FORCE_SCALAR`,
and `run.ps1` requires the two runs to print byte-identical output and the
same `DIGEST` line. The SIMD paths are therefore checked to be bit-exact
replacements for the scalar reference, and the per-primitive sweep in the same
file folds `k`, `nu`, `rmax`, `dmin`, `dmax`, the mask words, the packed
record and the chosen modes into a second digest for every predictor id, so a
divergence names the predictor that caused it. A successful run ends with:

```
parity ok: DIGEST <value> (identical streams)
ALL SUITES PASS
```

`tests/profile.c` and `tests/profile2.c` are micro-profilers for individual
primitives, not part of the suite.

## Benchmarking

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -I include tests/bench.c src/zpse_unity.c -o bench.exe
./bench.exe 300 5      # [iters] [reps], defaults 200 and 5
```

The harness compresses and decompresses a 64 KiB block of each pattern,
single-core, and reports the best of `reps` rounds for each direction (decode
is measured ten times per round) as GB/s plus the ratio and compressed size.
It then prints the machine's `memcpy`, `memset` and CRC32-C rates for the same
working set: those bound any codec on this format, because every block is
verified with a CRC32-C and the RAW fallback is a copy. The bench itself uses
`QueryPerformanceCounter`, so it is Windows-only as written.

### Performance

Measured with `./bench.exe 300 5` on a desktop x86-64 machine, 64 KiB blocks,
single core. Run the command above on your own machine to fill this in:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| zeros | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| incr | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| random | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| sparse | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| strided | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| const5A | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| alt00FF | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
| sawtooth | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c | run tests/bench.c |
